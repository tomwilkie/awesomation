    # This works in the other scanners as (a) we assume the
    # server is always there and (b) the server creates
    # instances on demand for things like wemo and hue.

    # (there is too much junk we can't control on most
    #  networks) - instead, the user will manually create
    # objects to represents phones coming and going.
    # Therefore, edge triggering isn't good enough
    # - the user might create the phone object after the
    # phone has been detected, and the server will miss
    # the event.  There we will also periodically send
    # a 'level-triggered' event - ie, just a list of
